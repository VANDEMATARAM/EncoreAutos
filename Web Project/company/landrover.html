        <p>Land Rover is a British brand of four-wheel drive cars, that exclusively offers premium and luxury sport utility vehicles, owned by multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, which has been owned by India's Tata Motors since 2008.The initial
            Land Rover is regarded as a British icon, and was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951. In 2001 it received the Queen's Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade. JLR currently build Land Rovers
            in Brazil, China, India, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. The Land Rover name was originally used by the Rover Company for a 4WD, off-road model, now known as the Land Rover Series, launched in 1948. Over time, it grew into its own brand,
            (and for a while also a company), encompassing a consistently growing range of four-wheel drive, off-road capable models. Starting with the much more upmarket 1970 Range Rover, and subsequent introductions of the mid-range Discovery and entry-level
            Freelander line, (in 1989 and 1997), as well as the 1990 Land Rover Defender refresh, the marque today includes two models of Discovery, four distinct models of Range Rover, and after a three-year hiatus, a second genaration of Defenders have
            gone into production for the 2020 model year â€“ in short or long wheelbase
