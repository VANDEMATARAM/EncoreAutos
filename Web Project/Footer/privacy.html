            <p>We gather certain types of information from and about the visitors to the Encore autos Automotive Network, and we believe our visitors should fully understand what information we gather from and about our visitors, and how we obtain, use,
                share and manage that information. The Encore autos Automotive Network consists of Encore autos.com and any other Web site that we identify as a part of the Edmunds Automotive Network; the mobile versions of our Web Sites; any apps that
                we offer; and widgets, tools and content from our Web site that we offer for display on third-party web sites or apps.
            </p>
            <p>This Privacy Statement discloses what information we gather on the Encore autos Automotive Network and how we obtain, use, share and manage it. Accordingly, this Privacy Statement is not applicable to information that we obtain through any
                other business activities. </p>

            <h2>Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p>We collect information that you voluntarily submit to the Encore autos Automotive Network using one or more devices to receive products and services or related information that you request from either us or companies with which we do business.
                The information you submit may include personally identifiable information such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. We refer to such personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to us in response to
                requests therefor on the Encore autos Automotive Network as your "Personal Information."
            </p>

            <p>We do not consider your city, state or ZIP code to be your Personal Information. We also collect information about the devices you use to access the Encore autos Automotive Network as soon as you as you visit the Encore autos Automotive Network.
                We do not consider this information to be your Personal Information. </p>

            <h2>Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p>Your Personal Information will be shared between us and the companies with which we do business, and may also be disclosed to other entities that work with us or those companies, to fulfill your request and to provide other products and services
                to you.</p>

            <p>In addition, if you provide your Personal Information through the use of one of our vehicle price quote or inquiry services or dealer communication services (collectively, "Dealer Inquiry and Communication Services"), your Personal Information
                will be shared with vehicle dealers, and may also be shared with the vehicle manufacturers and/or their affiliated entities, distributors, agents and contractors, who may use that information to contact you. In addition, if the Dealer
                Inquiry and Communication Service you use is "co-branded" (i.e., the page on which it appears displays the name of both Edmunds and one of our partners), your Personal Information may be shared with that partner. Edmunds cannot control,
                and is not responsible for, the manner in which any of such companies or other entities, distributors, agents, contractors or partners use your Personal Information.
            </p>

            <h2>Updating Your Personal Information</h2>

            <p>If any of your Personal Information submitted as a part of becoming a member of the Encore autos Automotive Network changes, you may update that information by logging into your membership account profile. If you do not have a membership account
                profile and would like to modify any Personal Information provided to the Encore autos Automotive Network through the use of one of our vehicle price quote or inquiry services, or otherwise, send a request to us through our Contact Us
