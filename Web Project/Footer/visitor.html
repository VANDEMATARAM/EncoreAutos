            <h2>Keeping Your Personal Information Private</h2>

            <p>Visitors should be aware that disclosure in the Community Services of your full name, street address or other personal information raises privacy concerns and may result in solicitations from third parties or unwanted communications. We disclaim

            <h1>The Community Services and Visitor-Submitted Content</h1>
            <h2>License of Visitor-Submitted Content to Us</h2>

            <p>You agree that, by submitting any Visitor-Submitted Content to us, you are granting to us and our designees a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully assignable, sublicensable, fully paid up and royalty-free license to use that Visitor-Submitted
                Content, without restrictions of any kind and without any payment or other consideration of any kind, or any permission or notification, to you or any third party. This license shall include, without limitation, the irrevocable right to
                reproduce, publish, create derivative works from, combine with other works, modify, alter, adapt, edit, reformat, translate, distribute copies, display, perform, provide to third parties and sublicense that Visitor-Submitted Content, and
                all rights therein, in the name of Edmunds.com, Inc. or its designees throughout the universe in perpetuity in any and all media now or hereafter known. </p>

            <p>This license provides us with the right to use any Visitor-Submitted Content for any purpose, including for advertising or other commercial use. These rights apply to your name, other personal information, photo, likeness and voice, if included
                in that Visitor-Submitted Content. If we publish your Visitor-Submitted Content or authorize or sublicense others to do so, your Visitor-Submitted Content may be edited for length or clarity or for any other reason (either before or after
                it is published), and it may be attributed to you by name and city (if provided to us) unless you expressly request that you remain anonymous. You waive any "moral rights" in your Visitor-Submitted Content. </p>

            <p>Encore autos shall have the exclusive option to purchase from you and acquire all right, title and interest, including, without limitation, any copyrights and other intellectual property law in and to the VSC you submit, which rights shall

                known. The option shall be exercisable by us from the date you submit the VSC until two years from that date. If we exercise the option, you agree to accept payment in the amount of $1000 USD or value in kind at our discretion, and you
                agree to execute, acknowledge and deliver such other instruments consistent with an assignment of the intellectual property as may be reasonably necessary to carry out or effectuate the purposes or intent of the assignment of the VSC.

                VSC, even if it violates this Visitor Agreement. </p>

                or deleted during the four hours after it is posted, but may not be revised or deleted by the Visitor who posted it after that time. Dealer Ratings and Reviews may not be revised or deleted by Visitors, but a review may be supplemented
                by the Member who submitted it. You understand that the VSC of other Visitors is based on their individual opinions and experiences, which may vary significantly from one person to the next. We do not endorse or guarantee the accuracy
                of any VSC, and you agree that we are not responsible for the accuracy of any VSC and will not be liable for any damages incurred as a result of the submission or use thereof. </p>
